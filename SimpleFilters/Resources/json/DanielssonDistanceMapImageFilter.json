Note the default value is TInputImage.\nThe input is assumed to contain numeric codes defining objects. The filter will produce as output the following images:\n\n\\li AVoronoi partitionusing the same numeric codes as the input.\n\\li Adistance mapwith the approximation to the euclidean distance. from a particular pixel to the nearest object to this pixel in the input image.\n\\li Avector mapcontaining the component of the vector relating the current pixel with the closest point of the closest object to this pixel. Given that the components of the distance are computed in \"pixels\", the vector is represented by an itk::Offset. That is, physical coordinates are not used.\nThis filter is N-dimensional and known to be efficient in computational time. The algorithm is the N-dimensional version of the 4SED algorithm given for two dimensions in:\nDanielsson, Per-Erik. Euclidean Distance Mapping.
