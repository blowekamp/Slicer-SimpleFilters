For the case of binary images the median can be obtained by simply counting the neighbors that are foreground.\nA median filter is one of the family of nonlinear filters. It is used to smooth an image without being biased by outliers or shot noise.\n\\see  Image\n\\see \n\\see  Neighborhood\n\\see \n\\see  NeighborhoodOperator\n\\see \n\\see  NeighborhoodIterator\n\n"
