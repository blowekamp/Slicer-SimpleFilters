  "detaileddescription" : "\\par Inputs and Outputs\nThis is an image-to-image filter. The dimensionality is arbitrary. The only dimensionality constraint is that the input and output images be of the same dimensions and size. To maintain integer arithmetic within the filter, the default output is the signed squared distance. This implies that the input image should be of type \"unsigned int\" or \"int\" whereas the output image is of type \"int\". Obviously, if the user wishes to utilize the image spacing or to have a filter with the Euclidean distance (as opposed to the squared distance), output image types of float or double should be used.\nThe inside is considered as having negative distances. Outside is treated as having positive distances. To change the convention, use the InsideIsPositive(bool) function.\n\\par Parameters\nSet/GetBackgroundValue specifies the background of the value of the input binary image. Normally this is zero and, as such, zero is the default value. Other than that, the usage is completely analogous to the itk::DanielssonDistanceImageFilter class except it does not return the Voronoi map.\nReference: C. R. Maurer, Jr., R. Qi, and V.
