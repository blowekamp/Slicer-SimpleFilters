  "briefdescription" : "Calculate masked normalized cross correlation using FFTs.\n",
  "detaileddescription" : "This filter calculates the masked normalized cross correlation (NCC) of two images under masks using FFTs instead of spatial correlation. It is much faster than spatial correlation for reasonably large structuring elements. This filter is not equivalent to simply masking the images first and then correlating them; the latter approach yields incorrect results because the zeros in the images still affect the metric in the correlation process. This filter implements the masked NCC correctly so that the masked-out regions are completely ignored. The fundamental difference is described in detail in the references below. If the masks are set to images of all ones, the result of this filter is the same as standard NCC.\nInputs: Two images are required as inputs, fixedImage and movingImage, and two are optional, fixedMask and movingMask. In the context of correlation, inputs are often defined as: \"image\" and \"template\". In this filter, the fixedImage plays the role of the image, and the movingImage plays the role of the template. However, this filter is capable of correlating any two images and is not restricted to small movingImages (templates). In the fixedMask and movingMask, non-zero positive values indicate locations of useful information in the corresponding image, whereas zero and negative values indicate locations that should be masked out (ignored). Internally, the masks are converted to have values of only 0 and 1. For each optional mask that is not set, the filter internally creates an image of ones, which is equivalent to not masking the image. Thus, if both masks are not set, the result will be equivalent to unmasked NCC. For example, if only a mask for the fixed image is needed, the movingMask can either not be set or can be set to an image of ones.\nOptional parameters: The RequiredNumberOfOverlappingPixels enables the user to specify how many voxels of the two images must overlap; any location in the correlation map that results from fewer than this number of voxels will be set to zero. Larger values zero-out pixels on a larger border around the correlation image. Thus, larger values remove less stable computations but also limit the capture range. If RequiredNumberOfOverlappingPixels is set to 0, the default, no zeroing will take place.\n Imagesize: fixedImage and movingImage need not be the same size, but fixedMask must be the same size as fixedImage, and movingMask must be the same size as movingImage. Furthermore, whereas some algorithms require that the \"template\" be smaller than the \"image\" because of errors in the regions where the two are not fully overlapping, this filter has no such restriction.\n Imagespacing: Since the computations are done in the pixel domain, all input images must have the same spacing.\nOutputs; The output is an image of RealPixelType that is the masked NCC of the two images and its values range from -1.0 to 1.0. The size of this NCC image is, by definition, size(fixedImage) + size(movingImage) - 1.\nExample filter usage:typedef itk::MaskedFFTNormalizedCorrelationImageFilter< ShortImageType, DoubleImageType >FilterType;FilterType::Pointerfilter=FilterType::New();filter->SetFixedImage(fixedImage);filter->SetMovingImage(movingImage);filter->SetFixedImageMask(fixedMask);filter->SetMovingImageMask(movingMask);filter->SetRequiredNumberOfOverlappingPixels(20);filter->Update();\n\\warning The pixel type of the output image must be of real type (float or double). ConceptChecking is used to enforce the output pixel type. You will get a compilation error if the pixel type of the output image is not float or double.\nReferences: 1) D.
